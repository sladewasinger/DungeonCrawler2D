# Dungeon Crawler 2D — v2

A browser-based, top-down 2D **real-time PvPvE multiplayer** dungeon crawler with a
full height axis, tonally inspired by the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. Players spawn
apart in a vast shared floor-world, fight monsters — and each other, or fistbump
instead — racing for the one-way stairway down. Safety exists only in safe rooms.
The signature system: a fully data-driven effects engine whose closed vocabulary of
primitives, tags, and interaction rules lets an **AI crafting system** invent
brand-new items at runtime, validated like any other content.

This is the **v2 rebuild** of the original prototype (frozen in [reference/](reference/README.md)):
same design, same server-authoritative architecture, rebuilt to a real visual and
engineering bar.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite client + local game server together
npm run test       # headless engine + protocol tests (vitest)
npm run typecheck  # strict TS across all packages
npm run lint       # standards enforcement (200-line cap, boundaries)
```

The full simulation and local server exist, but the v2 client does not yet wire them
into a playable `DungeonScene`; the default page currently shows the boot-ready
placeholder. To inspect the live terrain/entity gallery while the game scene is being
integrated, run `npm run dev -w @dc2d/client` and open:

```text
http://localhost:5173/?scene=gallery&camera=rooms
```

Useful `camera` values include `door`, `occlusion`, `pillar`, `solidmass`,
`landmark`, `chasm`, and `sanctuary`.

The gallery HUD reports the tile under the mouse, its logical surface type and height,
and any projected wall facade with its source tile and vertical span. Use this readout
when reporting terrain/rendering issues so visual cells can be distinguished from the
raised surface that owns them.

## Status

**v2 core slice in progress:** worldgen, multiplayer, movement/combat, effects
engine, items, and safe rooms at the new visual bar. Parties/chat/AI crafting are
architected (see docs) and land next.
